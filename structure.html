    <H1>EXERCISE</H1>
    <P>Exercise keeps us healthy and happy .<b><>Exercising daily can make you fit</u> </b> . It also improves your thinking ability and mental stability .Physical exercise is important for maintaining physical fitness and can contribute to maintaining a healthy weight, regulating the digestive system, building and maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength, and joint mobility, promoting physiological well-being, reducing surgical risks, and strengthening the immune system<b> Some studies indicate that exercise may increase life expectancy and the overall quality of life</b>.<br><br> People who participate in moderate to high levels of physical exercise have a lower mortality rate compared to individuals who by comparison are not physically active.<b><i> Moderate levels of exercise have been correlated with preventing aging by reducing inflammatory potential</i></b>. The majority of the benefits from exercise are achieved with around 3500 metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week, with diminishing returns at higher levels of activity.<b> For example, climbing stairs 10 minutes, vacuuming 15 minutes, gardening 20 minutes, running 20 minutes, and walking or bicycling for transportation can makes you fit </b> <div class="br"></div>  A lack of physical activity causes approximately 6% of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7% of type 2 diabetes, 10% of breast cancer and 10% of colon cancer worldwide. Overall, physical inactivity causes 9% of premature mortality <br><br>

    <br><br>Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot.<b> Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground. </b> This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.<br><br> A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity.<b> The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.</b>

<br> <Br> <b><I>  Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.</I></b>
    
    <U>It is assumed that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals.</U> Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE.<b> Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.</b>

   <br><br> <b><big>Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.</big></b> People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists", "bicyclists", or "bikers". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).

   A bicycle (or bike) is a small, human powered land vehicle with a seat, two wheels, two pedals, and a metal chain connected to cogs on the pedals and rear wheel. A frame gives the bike strength, and the other parts are attached to the frame. The name comes from these two words - the prefix "bi-" meaning two, and the suffix "-cycle" meaning wheel. It is powered by a person riding on top, who pushes the pedals around with his or her feet.

    Riding bicycles, which is also called cycling, is an important way to travel in several parts of the world. The most popular type of cycling is Utility cycling. It is also a common recreation, a good form of low-impact exercise, and a popular sport. Road bicycle racing is the second most popular spectator sport in the world. Bicycling uses less energy per mile than any other human transport.</>

    <h2>WALKING</h2> <br><br>

   <br><br> <p>Walking (also known as ambulation) is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals. Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits. Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the usable number of limbsâ€”even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk.[</p>
   <b>It is theorized that "walking" among tetrapods originated underwater with air-breathing fish that could "walk" underwater, giving rise (potentially with vertebrates like Tiktaalik)[18] to the plethora of land-dwelling life that walk on four or two limbs.</b>
   Pedestrianism is a sport that developed during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and was a popular spectator sport in the British Isles. By the end of the 18th century, and especially with the growth of the popular press, feats of foot travel over great distances (similar to a modern ultramarathon) gained attention, and were labeled "pedestrianism". Interest in the sport, and the wagering which accompanied it, spread to the United States, Canada, and Australia in the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, Pedestrianism was largely displaced by the rise in modern spectator sports and by controversy involving rules, which limited its appeal as a source of wagering and led to its inclusion in the amateur athletics movement. Pedestrianism was first codified in the last half of the 19th century, evolving into what would become racewalking, By the mid 19th century, competitors were often expected to extend their legs straight at least once in their stride, and ob

   <h2>SKIPPING</h2>

   <b>A skipping rope (British English) or jump rope (American English) is a tool used in the sport of skipping/jump rope where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of skipping/jump rope, including single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three-person speed (Double Dutch), and three-person freestyle (Double Dutch freestyle)</b>

 <br><br>
   Here are a few major organizations that support jump rope as a sport. Often separated by sex and age, events include hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. In the US, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do have sanction official events for elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers use a variety of basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hits the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.

   In the Philippines, about 180,000 fourth graders and teachers from at least 3,600 schools nationwide were chosen as beneficiaries of jump ropes through the joint project of the energy drink company, Department of Education (DepEd), and Philippine Jump Rope Association (PJRA).
   
   The Jump Rope for the Public School System project aims to complement with physical fitness by introducing children to home- based sports such as Jumping Rope.
